# Prolog-n-ary

This project was developed as part of the "Declarative Programming: Logic and Constraints" course. 
The main objective is to revisit and reinforce the fundamental concepts taught in the course coding the n-ary partitions of a number. 
The focus is on n-ary partitions of a number, exploring various aspects of ISO-Prolog programming.
